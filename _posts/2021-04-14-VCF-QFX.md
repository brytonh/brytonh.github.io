title: 2 weeks until JNCIE-DC 
--- 

I scheduled my JNCIE-DC attempt a few months back **for end of April**, purchased the official Juniper JNCIE-DC workbook, and I have hit the topics in the blueprint. I was able to complete almost all of the relevant labs in an EVE-NG environment with vMX and vQFX devices. But, I was unable to lab the Virtual Chassis Fabric as well as applying output traffic profiles to interfaces in the QFX Class of Service configuration. Time for some hardware!

I'll admit I am very fortunate my place of work allowed me to grab a couple of these *lying around* for a small VCF config. The configuration required is not lengthy, and I have plenty of experience with "regular" virtual chassis, but I still wanted to search for some possible hesitations. 

What I'd really like to do is see VCF "under the hood." As I understand it, the protocol is leveraging IS-IS routing variant. I've never seen the packet structure posted anywhere and I think that would be really interesting to document a pcap on... Maybe **To Be Continued** on that part.
