There were several times along the JNCIE-SP journey that I thought about stopping and starting a blog to try and collect all the information I'd learned in some sort of digital archive. But, I never started one, I kept pushing on, and did finally pass my JNCIE-SP in November 2020. 

It was brutal. It was exhausting. It was a pain. And - it was well worth it. 

When I was going through the constant studying, I often would look for other candidates' documented experiences with the JNCIE journey or exam. I would like for blogs that outlined the experience, what to expect, and how to cope with the JNCIE learning process in general. I found many sources, networkfuntimes.com, momcanfixanything.com, and inetzero.com to name a few. It was so helpful being able to see that other people had went through this same journey, this same obsession with learning the content, and that they had survived and thrived at the end by passing.
