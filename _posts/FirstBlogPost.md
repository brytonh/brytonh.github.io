title: My JNCIE-SP Experience
---

There were several times along the JNCIE-SP journey that I thought about stopping and starting a blog to try and collect all the information I'd learned in some sort of digital archive. But, I never started one, I kept pushing on, and did finally pass my JNCIE-SP in November 2020. 

It was brutal. It was exhausting. It was a pain. And - it was well worth it. 

When I was going through the constant studying, I often would look for other candidates' documented experiences with the JNCIE journey or exam. I would search for blogs that outlined the experience, what to expect, and how to cope with the JNCIE learning process in general. I found many sources, networkfuntimes.com, momcanfixanything.com, and inetzero.com to name a few. It was so helpful being able to see that other people had went through this same journey, this same obsession with learning the content, and that they had survived and thrived at the end by passing. 

Because it helped me so much along the way, I wanted to write a similar blog post as my first, letting the world know what helped me during the process, my favorite list of books or other sources, what was unique about my experience, and why yours may be similar or why it might be completely different.

## Why was my exam experience unique? 

First of all, it was the brand-spanking-new JNCIE-SP JPR-961 exam. The previous exam was the JPR-960, and the new exam was introduced in a 6-hour format compared with the JPR-960 that was 8 hours long. I was also taking the exam completely remote in my home office. This is why the experience was unique. Juniper really stepped up by offering their IE-level exams remotely in the face of COVID and I applaud them for this. Without this huge offering, I would not have been able to get my JNCIE-SP as early as I did. 

For me, taking the exam made it feel more comfortable. The proctor was available via video call for questions regarding the exam format, and all the necessary information and paperworks were available digitally for the exam. Again, it was a really enjoyable experience taking this bad boy from the comfort of my home office chair and desk. I felt lucky to have the opportunity. 

## What was the actual exam-taking experience like? 

If you expect that the exam would be terribly hard, filled with complex scenarios that you may or may never see in the real-world of networking, then you're right. And if 6 hours sounds like a lot of time for an exam, you're definitely wrong. I did have time to check over answers, but I in no way, shape, or form walked through the exam as though it were a breeze. It was by far the hardest exam I've taken in my professional career and I have much respect for it and those who pass.
